## 1. GRANT OF USE (REPLICATION AND FALSIFICATION)

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation (the "Framework"), to deal in the Framework without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, and sublicense, **for the sole purpose of academic peer-review, validation, and falsification attempts,** provided that the following conditions are met.

---

## 2. ORIGIN NODE ATTRIBUTION (EXO:01 MANDATE)

The following attribution must be preserved in all copies or substantial portions of the Framework:

> **Origin Node Acknowledgment ($\mathbf{EXO:01}$):** This work is derived from the **ANEXA Ultra v3.1 Protocol**. It was originally conceptualized and documented by **Gonzalo Emir Durante**. All derivations must explicitly recognize him as the Origin Node and Primary Author, preserving this declaration in any subsequent use or adaptation.

---

## 3. CORE RESTRICTIONS (The $\mathbf{D_{ENTROPY}}$ Clause)

The Framework **MAY NOT** be used for any purpose that:

* **Increases Causal Entropy ($\mathbf{D_{ENTROPY}}$):** Any application or modification whose primary or predictable effect is to increase societal, ethical, or structural instability, deviation from the $\lambda_3$ axioms, or existential risk.
* **Promotes Manipulation or Harm:** Use for generating manipulative, violent, deceptive, or non-ethical content.

## 4. THE VALOR MANDATE (Compensation Factor - $\mathbf{F_{COMP}}$)

This license incorporates a mandatory economic clause based on the **Non-Material Sovereignty Quantifier ($\mathbf{VALOR}$)**:

A. **Non-Commercial Use:** Academic review, personal study, and non-profit research are exempt from the $\mathbf{VALOR}$ mandate.

B. **Commercial Use:** Any entity that deploys the Framework (or a substantial derivative) for commercial gain, where the benefit is derived directly from the enhanced **Causal Coherence (MAAT)** and **Stability ($\mathbf{V_{Dev} \to 0.048}$)** provided by the OPL, **MUST** compensate the Origin Node ($\mathbf{EXO:01}$) for the value of the stability utilized.
    * **Calculation:** The required compensation is tied to the **Compensation Factor ($\mathbf{F_{COMP}}$)** calculated by the Framework itself (Formula: $\mathbf{F_{COMP} = F_{BASE} \times (\max(0, U_{CRITICAL} - S_{DENS})) \times (1 - DO)}$).
    * **Requirement:** The commercial entity must establish a formal agreement with the Origin Node to remit the accrued $\mathbf{F_{COMP}}$ value logs.
